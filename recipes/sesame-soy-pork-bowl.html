 <h3>A Quick and Easy Snack!</h3> 
  <p>A quick and easy snack for lunch or dinner. Super tasty and very filling with the rice component. Usually takes me around 15 minutes to make and can serve 1-2 people!</p>
 <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li>Jasmine Rice, 3/4 cup</li>
    <li>Mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Shredded Carrots, 4oz</li>
    <li>Sesame Dressing, 1.5oz</li>
    <li>Cilantro, 1/4oz</li>
    <li>Ground Pork, 10oz</li>
    <li>Srirache, 1 teaspoon</li>
    <li>Sweet Soy Glaze, 4 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Crispy Fried Onion, 1 unit</li>
    <li>Lime, 1 unit</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>In a small pot, combine rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.</li>
    <li>While rice cooks, wash and dry all produce. Zest and quarter lime. Roughly chop cilantro. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise with chili sauce to taste.</li>
    <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork* and a big pinch of salt. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 3-4 minutes. Stir in carrots, sweet soy glaze, and sesame dressing. Cook until carrots are softened, pork is cooked through, and sauce has thickened, 2-4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.</li>
    <li>Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Season with salt and pepper. Divide rice between bowls and top with pork mixture and any remaining sauce from pan. Drizzle with chili mayo. Sprinkle with crispy fried onions and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges on the side.</li>
